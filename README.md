## Abstract :

<details>


Motivation  
The rising demand for energy efficiency has accelerated the adoption of smart automation in residential, commercial, and institutional spaces. While ensuring occupant comfort is essential, uncontrolled energy usage leads to higher costs and environmental impact. By regulating power consumption based on real-time occupancy, this project delivers a sustainable and practical solution that balances comfort with resource optimization.

### Problem Statement  
Large-capacity spaces face two persistent challenges:  
1. *Inefficient energy utilization* – Appliances often remain active even when rooms are underutilized or vacant, causing significant power wastage.  
2. *Lack of occupancy awareness* – Without accurate monitoring, management cannot prevent overcrowding or optimize resource allocation.  

### Proposed Solution  
The system addresses these issues by:  
- Automatically counting visitors.  
- Adjusting appliance usage according to occupancy.  
- Enforcing capacity restrictions for safety.

## 2. Features
- *Automatic Visitor Counting* – Infrared/ultrasonic sensors track entry and exit sequences, with a microcontroller maintaining a live occupancy count.  
- *LED Occupancy Display* – A bar-graph LED indicator provides a clear visual of how filled the room is, with all LEDs illuminated at full capacity.  
- *Proportional Power Control* – Appliances such as lights, fans, and AC units operate at scaled intensities: reduced power for partial occupancy and maximum output for full occupancy.  
- *Capacity Restriction & Alert* – When the limit is reached, entry is blocked and an alert (buzzer or LED) signals “Room Full.”
